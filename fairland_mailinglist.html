<h1>Fairland Mailing List</h1>

In 2010, Steve Waterbury set up an e-mail list server for the Fairland Saturday-morning tennis doubles players on his web site, pangalactic.us.

<h2>Basic Instructions</h2>

<pre>
We now have a fairland-tennis-saturday@pangalactic.us mailing list
so we don't have to bother with that big CC list!

To post to the list, send your email to:

<a href="mailto:fairland-tennis-saturday@pangalactic.us">fairland-tennis-saturday@pangalactic.us</a>

If you ever want to unsubscribe or change your options (eg, switch to or from
digest mode, change your password, etc.), this can be done at the list
information page:

<a href="https://pangalactic.us/mailman/listinfo/fairland-tennis-saturday">https://pangalactic.us/mailman/listinfo/fairland-tennis-saturday</a>

You can also make such adjustments via email by sending a message to:

<a href="mailto:fairland-tennis-saturday-request@pangalactic.us">fairland-tennis-saturday-request@pangalactic.us</a>

with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.

You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.

Normally, Mailman will remind you of your pangalactic.us mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
</pre>

<h2>More detail on modifying your settings</h2>

<pre>
Initially everyone was subscribed to the list using only one of their email
addresses.  Some will want to be able to send messages to the list from two
addresses (e.g. home and work) -- not a problem, just go to the list
information page:

<a href="https://pangalactic.us/mailman/listinfo/fairland-tennis-saturday">https://pangalactic.us/mailman/listinfo/fairland-tennis-saturday</a>

... and subscribe using your other address.  Now you will have
2 addresses from which you can send email to the list.

One more thing:  if you would prefer not to receive 2 (or more)
copies of each list message (one at each address), pick one of
your addresses and set it up *not* to receive list messages -- to
do that:

Go to the list info page (URL above) and down at the bottom
you'll see a button that says "Unsubscribe or edit options" --
enter the address where you *don't* want to receive list mail
and click the button.  Then you'll get a page with lots of
stuff -- the bottom half says "Your fairland-tennis-saturday
Subscription Options".  The first option is "Mail delivery" --
set that to "Disabled", then scroll down and click on the
"Submit My Changes" button, and you're done!

If you have any questions, send them to me (Steve) at:
<a href="mailto:waterbug@pangalactic.us">waterbug@pangalactic.us</a>
