<h3>Q: Why are there so few grass and clay courts in the USA?</h3>

A: It's simple -- <a href="http://climate.gsfc.nasa.gov/">climate!</a> 
There is either too much or not enough sunshine and precipitation for grass or clay to thrive over most of North America. 
Asphalt has proven to be a much hardier survivor of the harsh climate between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. 
Interestingly, there are some parts of the USA where asphalt does not readily grow, such as in national parks. 
It was recently discovered that the asphalt will grow more readily in the parks if the trees are removed. 

<h3>Q: What is the weirdest surface used for tennis?</h3>

A: It's gotta be <b>shale</b>.  Actually, there are quite a few shale courts in the UK - a bit 'slidey' (not unlike clay) but hard wearing and even bounce. 
For instance, shale is used by the <a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/kevin.foster1/STCintro.html">Strines Tennis Club in Cheshire, England</a>.
