The following Rules and Cases and Decisions are the official Code of
the International Tennis Federation, of which the United States Tennis
Association is a member. USTA Comments have the same weight and force
in USTA tournaments as do ITF Cases and Decisions.<P>

When a match is played without officials, USTA Regulation I.M. shall apply in any situation not covered by the rules.  <A HREF="http://rsd.gsfc.nasa.gov/tennisclub/tennis.code.html">The Code</A> shall apply in any situation not covered by USTA Regulation I.M.<P>

Except where otherwise stated, every reference in these Rules to the
masculine includes the feminine gender.<P>

Amendments to the USTA Comments may be made in accordance with Article VIII of the USTA Regulations provided such amendments are not inconsistent with the Rules of Tennis of the International Tennis Federation.
<P>
<HR><P>
<H2><A NAME="SG">The Singles Game</A>
</H2><P>
<H3><A NAME="R1">RULE 1</A><BR>
The Court</H3><P>

The court shall be a rectangle 78 feet (23.77m.) long and 27 feet
(8.23m.)  wide.<BR> 
[<B>USTA Comment:</B> See <A HREF="#R34">Rule 34</A> for a doubles court.]<P>

It shall be divided across the middle by a net suspended from a cord
or metal cable of a maximum diameter of one-third of an inch (0.8cm.),
the ends of which shall be attached to, or pass over, the tops of two
posts, which shall be not more than 6 inches (15cm.) square or 6
inches (15cm.) in diameter. These posts shall not be higher than 1
inch (2.5 cm.) above the top of the net cord. The centers of the posts
shall be 3 feet (0.914m.) outside the court on each side and the
height of the posts shall be such that the top of the cord or metal
cable shall be 3 feet 6 inches (1.07m.) above the ground.<P>

When a combined doubles (see <A HREF="#R34">Rule 34</A>) and singles court with a doubles
net is used for singles, the net must be supported to a height of 3
feet 6 inches (1.07m.) by means of two posts, called "singles sticks",
which shall be not more than 3 inches (7.5cm.) square or 3 inches
(7.5cm.) in diameter. The centers of the singles sticks shall be 3
feet (0.914m.) outside the singles court on each side.<P>

The net shall be extended fully so that it fills completely the space
between the two posts and shall be of sufficiently small mesh to
prevent the ball passing through. The height of the net shall be 3
feet (0.914m.) at the center, where it shall be held down taut by a
strap not more than 2 inches (5cm.) wide and completely white in
colour. There shall be a band covering the cord or metal cable and the
top of the net of not less than 2 inches (5cm.) nor more than 2.5 inches
(6.3cm.) in depth on each side and completely white in colour.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> An approved method for obtaining proper net tautness is: Loosen the center strap.  Tighten the net cord until it is approximately 40 inches above the ground, being careful not to overtighten the net.  Tighten the center strap until the center of the net is 36 inches above the ground.  These measurements should always be made before the first match of the day.]
<P>

There shall be no advertisement on the net, strap, band or singles sticks.<P>

The lines bounding the ends and sides of the Court shall respectively
be called the base-lines and the side-lines. On each side of the net,
at a distance of 21 feet (6.40m.) from it and parallel with it, shall
be drawn the service-lines. The space on each side of the net between
the service-line and the side-lines shall be divided into two equal
parts called the service-courts by the center service-line which must
be 2 inches (5cm.) in width, drawn half-way between, and parallel
with, the side-lines. Each base-line shall be bisected by an imaginary
continuation of the center service-line to a line 4 inches (lOcm.)
in length and 2 inches (5cm.) in width called the center mark drawn
inside the Court, at right angles to and in contact with such
base-lines. All other lines shall be not less than 1 inch (2.5cm.) nor
more than 2 inches (5cm.) in width, except the base-line, which may be
4 inches (10cm.) in width, and all measurements shall be made to the
outside of the lines. All lines shall be of uniform colour.<P>

If advertising or any other material is placed at the back of the
court, it may not contain white, or yellow. A light colour may only be
used if this does not interfere with the vision of the players.<P>

If advertisements are placed on the chairs of the Linesmen sitting at the back
of the court, they may not contain white, or yellow. A light colour may only be
used if this does not interfere with the vision of the players.<P>

<B>ITF Note 1:</B> In the case of the <I>Davis Cup</I> or other Official Championships of the International Tennis Federation, there shall be a space behind each base-line of not less than 21 feet (6.4m.), and at the sides of
not less than 12 feet (3.66m.).  The chairs of the linesmen may be placed at the back of the court within the 21 feet or at the side of the court within the 12 feet, provided they do not protrude into that area more than 3 feet (.914m).<P>

<B>ITF Note 2:</B> In the case of the stadium courts in the <I>Davis Cup</I> World Group and the Federation Cup Main Draw there should be space behind each baseline of not less than 27 feet (8.23m) and at the sides of not less than 15 feet (4.57m).<P>

<B>ITF Note 3:</B> At club or recreation level, the space behind each baseline should be not less than 18 feet (5.5m) and at the sides not less than 10 feet (3.05m).

<H3><A NAME="R2">RULE 2</A><BR>
Permanent Fixtures</H3><P>

The permanent fixtures of the Court shall include not only the net,
posts, singles sticks, cord or metal cable, strap and band, but also,
where there are any such, the back and side stops, the stands, fixed
or movable seats and chairs round the Court, and their occupants, all
other fixtures around and above the Court, and the Umpire, Net-cord
Judge, Foot-fault Judge, Linesmen and Ball Boys when in their
respective places.<P>

<B>ITF Note:</B> For the purpose of this Rule, the word "Umpire" comprehends the
Umpire, the persons entitled to a seat on the Court, and all those
persons designated to assist the Umpire in the conduct of a match.<P>

<H3><A NAME="R3">RULE 3</A><BR>
The Ball</H3><P>

The ball shall have a uniform outer surface and shall be white or
yellow in colour. If there are any seams, they shall be stitchless.<P>

The ball shall be more than two and a half inches (6.35cm.) and less
than two and five-eighths inches (6.67cm.) in diameter, and more than
two ounces (56.7 grams) and less than two and one-sixteenth ounces
(58.5 grams) in weight.<P>

The ball shall have a bound of more than 53 inches (135cm.) and less
than 58 inches (147cm.) when dropped 100 inches (254cm.) upon a
concrete base.<P>

The ball shall have a forward deformation of more than .220 of an inch
(.56cm.) and less than .290 of an inch (.74cm.) and a return
deformation of more than .315 of an inch (.80cm.) and less than .425
of an inch (1.08cm.) at 18 lb.  (8.165kg.) load. The two deformation
figures shall be the averages of three individual readings along three
axes of the ball and no two individual readings shall differ by more
than .030 of an inch (.08cm.) in each case.<P>

For play above 4,000 feet (1219m) in altitude above sea level, two
additional types of ball may be used. The first type is identical to
those described above except that the bound shall be more than 48
inches (121.92cm) and less than 53 inches (135cm) and the ball shall
have an internal pressure that is greater than the external pressure.
This type of tennis ball is commonly known as a pressurized ball. The
second type is identical to those described above except that they
shall have a bound of more than 53 inches (135cm) and less than 58
inches (147cm) and shall have an internal pressure that is
approximately equal to the external pressure and have been
acclimatized for 60 days or more at the altitude of the specific
tournament. This type of tennis ball is commonly known as a
zero-pressure or non-pressurized ball.<P>

All tests for bound, size and deformation shall be made in accordance
with the Regulations in the <A HREF="#A1">Appendix</A> hereto.<P>

<H3><A NAME="R4">RULE 4</A><BR>
The Racket<P>
</H3>
Rackets failing to comply with the following specifications are not
approved for play under the Rules of Tennis:<P>

<B>(a)</B> The hitting surface of the rachet shall be flat and consist of a
pattern of crossed strings connected to a frame and alternately
interlaced or bonded where they cross; and the stringing pattern shall
be generally uniform, and in particular not less dense in the center
than in any other area. The strings shall be free of attached objects
and protrusions other than those utilized solely and specifically to
limit or prevent wear and tear or vibration and which are reasonable
in size and placement for such purposes.<P>

<B>(b)</B> The frame of the racket shall not exceed 32 inches (81.28cm.) in
overall length, including the handle and 12.5 inches (31.75cm.) in
overall width. The strung surface shall not exceed 15.5 inches
(39.37cm.) in overall length, and 11.5 inches (29.21cm.) in overall
width.<P>

<B>(c)</B> The frame, including the handle, shall be free of attached objects
and devices other than those utilized solely and specifically to limit
or prevent wear and tear or vibration, or to distribute weight. Any
objects and devices must be reasonable in size and placement for such
purposes.<P>

<B>(d)</B> The frame, including the handle and the strings, shall be free of
any device which makes it possible to change materially the shape of
the racket, or to change the weight distribution in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the racket which would alter the swing moment of inertia, during the playing of a point.<P>

The International Tennis Federation shall rule on the question of
whether any racket or prototype complies with the above specifications
or is otherwise approved, or not approved, for play. Such ruling may
be undertaken on its own initiative, or upon application by any party
with a bona fide interest therein, including any player, equipment
manufacturer or National Association or members thereof. Such rulings
and applications shall be made in accordance with the applicable
Review and Hearing Procedures of the International Tennis Federation,
copies of which may be obtained from the office of the Secretary.<P>

<B>Case 1.</B> Can there be more than one set of strings on the hitting
surface of a racket?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> No. The rule clearly mentions a pattern, and not patterns,
of crossed strings.<P>

<B>Case 2.</B> Is the stringing pattern of a racket considered to be
generally uniform and flat if the strings are on more than one plane?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> No.<P>

<B>Case 3.</B> Can a vibration dampening device be placed on the strings of a
racket and if so here can it be placed?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> Yes; but such devices may only be placed outside the pattern
of crossed strings.<P>

<H3><A NAME="R5">RULE 5</A><BR>
Server and Receiver<P>
</H3>
The players shall stand on opposite sides of the net; the player who
first delivers the ball shall be called the Server, and the other the
Receiver.<P>

<B>Case 1.</B> Does a player, attempting  stroke, lose the point if he crosses an imaginary line in the extension of the net,<P>

<B>(a)</B> before striking the ball,<P>

<B>(b)</B> after striking the ball?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> He does not lose the point in either case by crossing the
imaginary line and provided he does not enter the lines bounding his
opponents Court (<A HREF="#R20e">Rule 20 (e)</A>) In regard to hindrance, his opponent my ask
for the decision of the Umpire under <A HREF="#R21">Rules 21</A> and <A HREF="#R25">25</A>.<P>

<B>Case 2.</B> The Server claims that the Receiver must stand within the
lines bounding his Court. Is this necessary?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> No. The Receiver my stand wherever he pleases on his own side
of the net.<P>

<H3><A NAME="R6">RULE 6</A><BR>
Choice of Ends and Service</H3><P>

The choice of ends and the right to be Server or Receiver in the first
game shall be decided by toss. The player winning the toss may choose
or require his opponent to choose:<P>

<B>(a)</B> The right to be Server or Receiver, in which case the other player
shall choose the end; or<P>

<B>(b)</B> The end, in which case the other player shall choose the right to
be Server or Receiver.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> The toss shall be made before the warm-up.  Choices should be made promptly after the toss and are irrevocable, except that if the match is postponed or suspended before the start of the match.]<P>

<H3><A NAME="R7">RULE 7</A><BR>
The Service</H3><P>

The service shall be delivered in the following manner. Immediately
before commencing to serve, the Server shall stand with both feet at
rest behind (i.e.  further from the net than) the base-line, and
within the imaginary continuations of the center-mark and side-line.
The Server shall then project the ball by hand into the air in any
direction and before it hits the ground strike it with his racket, and
the delivery shall be deemed to have been completed at the moment of
the impact of the racket and the ball. A player with the use of only
one arm may utilize his racket for the projection.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> The service begins when the Server takes a ready position (i.e., both feet at rest behind the baseline) and ends when his racket makes contact with the ball or when he misses the ball in attempting to serve it.]<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> There is no restriction regarding the kind of service which may be used; that is, the player may use an underhand or overhand service at his discretion.]<P>

<B>Case 1.</B> May the Server in a singles game take his stand behind the
portion of the base-line between the side-lines of the Singles Court
and the Doubles Court?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> No.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> The server may stand anywhere in back of the baseline between the imaginary extensions of the center mark and the singles
sideline.]<P>

<B>Case 2.</B> If a player, when serving, throws up two or more balls instead
of one, does he lose that service?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> No. A let should be called, but if the Umpire regards the
action as deliberate he may take action under <A HREF="#R21">Rule 21</A>.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> There is no restriction regarding the kind of service
which may be used; that is, the player may use an underhand or
overhand service at his discretion.]<P>

<H3><A NAME="R8">RULE 8</A><BR>
Foot Fault</H3><P>

<B>(a)</B> The Server shall throughout the delivery of the service:<P>

<B>(i)</B> Not change his position by walking or running. The Server shall not
by slight movements of the feet which do not materially affect the
location originally taken up by him, be deemed "to change his position
by walking or running".<P>

<B>(ii)</B> Not touch, with either foot, any area other than that behind the
base-line within the imaginary extensions of the center mark and
side-lines.<P>

<B>(b)</B> The word "foot" means the extremity of the leg below the ankle.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> This rule covers the most decisive stroke in the game, and there is no justification for its not being obeyed by players and
enforced by officials. No official has the right to instruct any umpire to disregard violations of it. In a non-officiated match, the Receiver, or his partner, may call foot faults after all efforts (appeal to the server, request for an umpire, etc.) have failed and the foot faulting is so flagrant as to be clearly perceptible from the Receiver's side.<P>

It is improper for any official to warn a player that he is in danger
of having a foot fault called on him. On the other hand if a player in
all sincerity, asks for an explanation of how he foot faulted, either
the Line Umpire or the Chair Umpire should give him that information.]<P>

<H3><A NAME="R9">RULE 9</A><BR>
Delivery of Service</H3><P>

<B>(a)</B> In delivering the service, the Server shall stand alternately
behind the right and left Courts beginning from the right in every
game. If service from a wrong half of the Court occurs and is
undetected, all play resulting from such wrong service or services
shall stand, but the inaccuracy of station shall be corrected
immediately it is discovered.<P>

<A NAME="R9b"><B>(b)</B> The</A> ball served shall pass over the net and hit the ground within
the Service Court which is diagonally opposite, or upon any line
bounding such Court, before the Receiver returns it.<P>

<H3><A NAME="R10">RULE 10</A><BR>
Service Fault</H3><P>

The Service is a fault:<P>

<B>(a)</B> If the Server commits any breach of <A HREF="#R7">Rules 7</A>, <A HREF="#R8">8</A> or <A HREF="#R9b">9(b)</A>;<P>

<B>(b)</B> If he misses the ball in attempting to strike it;<P>

<A NAME="R10c"><B>(c)</B> If</A> the ball served touches a permanent fixture (other than the net, strap or band) before it hits the ground.<P>

<B>Case 1.</B> After throwing a ball up preparatory to serving the Server
decides not to strike at it and catches it instead. Is it a fault?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> No.<P>  

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> As long as the Server makes no attempt to strike the ball it is immaterial whether he catches it in his hand or on his racket or lets it drop to the ground.]<P>

<B>Case 2.</B> In serving in a singles game played on a Doubles Court with
doubles posts and singles sticks the ball hits a singles stick and then hits the ground within the lines of the correct Service Court. Is this a fault or a
let?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> In serving it is a fault because the singles stick the
doubles post and that portion of the net or band between them are
permanent fixtures. (<A HREF="#R2">Rules 2</A> and <A HREF="#R10">10</A> and <A HREF="#R24N">note to Rule 24</A>.).<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> The significant point governing Case 2 is that the part of the net and band outside the singles sticks is not part of the net
over which this singles match is being played. Thus such a serve is a
fault under the provisions of Article (c) above . . . By the same
token this would be a fault also if it were a singles game played with
permanent posts in the singles position.  See <A HREF="#R24c1">Case 1 under Rule 24</A> for difference between "service" and "good return" with respect to a ball's hitting a net post.]<P>

<H3><A NAME="R11">RULE 11</A><BR>
Second Service</H3><P>

After a fault (if it is the first fault) the Server shall serve again
from behind the same half of the Court from which he served that
fault, unless the service was from the wrong half, when, in accordance
with <A HREF="#R9">Rule 9</A>, the Server shall be entitled to one service only from
behind the other half.<P>

<B>Case 1.</B> A player serves from a wrong Court. He loses the point and
then claims it was a fault because of his wrong station.<P>

<B>Decision.</B> The point stands as played and the next service should be
from the correct station according to the score.<P>

<B>Case 2.</B> The point score being 15 all the Server by mistake serves from
the left-hand Court. He wins the point. He then serves again from the
right-hand Court delivering a fault. This mistake in station is then
discovered. Is he entitled to the previous point? From which Court
should he next serve?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> The previous point stands. The next service should be from
the left-hand Court the score being 30/15 and the Server has served
one fault.<P>

<H3><A NAME="R12">RULE 12</A><BR>
When To Serve</H3><P>

The Server shall not serve until the Receiver is ready. If the latter
attempts to return the service, he shall be deemed ready. If, however,
the Receiver signifies that he is not ready, he may not claim a fault
because the ball does not hit the ground within the limits fixed for
the service.<P>

<A NAME="R12com">[<B>USTA Comment:</B></A> The Server must wait until the Receiver is ready for the second service as well as the first, and if the Receiver claims to be not ready and does not make any effort to return a service, the Server's claim for the point may not be honored even though the
service was good. However, the Receiver, having indicated he is ready,
may not become unready unless some outside interference takes place.<P>

<H3><A NAME="R13">RULE 13</A><BR>
The Let</H3><P>

In all cases where a let has to be called under the rules, or to
provide for an interruption to play, it shall have the following
interpretations:<P>

<B>(a)</B> When called solely in respect of a service that one service only
shall be replayed.<P>

<B>(b)</B> When called under any other circumstance, the point shall be
replayed.<P>

<B>Case 1.</B> A service is interrupted by some cause outside those defined
in <A HREF="#R14">Rule 14</A>. Should the service only be replayed?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> No the whole point must be replayed.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> If the interruption occurs during delivery of the second service, the Server gets two serves.  Example: On a second service a linesman calls "fault" and immediately corrects it, the Receiver meanwhile having let the ball go by.  The Server is entitled to two serves, on this ground: The corrected call means that the Server has put the ball into play with a good service, and once the ball is in play and a let is called, the point must be replayed.  Note, however, that if the serve is an unmistakable ace - that is, the Umpire is sure that the erroneous call had no part in the Receiver's inability to play the ball - the point should be declared for the Server.<P>

If a delay between first and second serves is caused by the Receiver, by an official or by an outside interference the whole point shall be replayed; if the delay is caused by the Server, the Server has one serve to come.  A spectator's outcry (of "out", "fault" or other) is not a valid basis for replay of a point, but action should be taken to prevent a recurrence.]<P>

<B>Case 2.</B> If a ball in play becomes broken, should a let be called?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> Yes.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> A ball shall be regarded as having become "broken" if,
in the opinion of the Chair Umpire, it is found to have lost compression to the point of being unfit for further play, or unfit for any reason, and it is clear the defective ball was the one in play.]<P>

<H3><A NAME="R14">RULE 14</A><BR>
The "Let" in Service</H3><P>

The service is a let:<P>

<A NAME="R14a"><B>(a)</B> If</A> the ball served touches the net, strap or band, and is
otherwise good, or, after touching the net, strap or band, touches the
Receiver or anything which he wears or carries before hitting the
ground.<P>

<B>(b)</B> If a service or a fault is delivered when the Receiver is not
ready (see <A HREF="#R12">Rule 12</A>).<P>

In case of a let, that particular service shall not count, and the
Server shall serve again, but a service let does not annul a previous
fault.<P>

<H3><A NAME="R15">RULE 15</A><BR>
Order of Service</H3><P>

At the end of the first game the Receiver shall become Server, and the
Server Receiver; and so on alternately in all the subsequent games of
a match. If a player serves out of turn, the player who ought to have
served shall serve as soon as the mistake is discovered, but all
points scored before such discovery shall be reckoned. If a game shall
have been completed before such discovery, the order of service
remains as altered. A fault served before such discovery shall not be
reckoned.<P>

<H3><A NAME="R16">RULE 16</A><BR>
When Players Change Ends</H3><P>

The players shall change ends at the end of the first, third and every
subsequent alternate game of each set, and at the end of each set
unless the total number of games in such set is even, in which case
the change is not made until the end of the first game of the next
set.<P>

If a mistake is made and the correct sequence is not followed the

The Ball in Play</H3><P>

A ball is in play from the moment at which it is delivered in service.
Unless a fault or a let is called it remains in play until the point
is decided.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> A point is not decided simply when, or because, a good shot has clearly passed a player, or when an apparently bad shot passes over a baseline or sideline. An outgoing ball is still definitely in play until it actually strikes the ground, backstop or a permanent fixture (other than the net, posts, singles sticks, cord or metal cable, strap or band), or a player. The same applies to a good ball, bounding after it has landed in the proper court. A ball that becomes imbedded in the net is out of play.]<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> When a ball is hit into the net and the player on the other side, thinking the ball is coming over, strikes at it and hits the next he loses the point if his touching the net occurs while the ball is still in play.]<P>

<A NAME="R17c1"><B>Case 1.</B></A> A player fails to make a good return. No call is made and the ball remains in play. May his opponent later claim the point after the rally has ended?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> No. The point may not be claimed if the players continue to
play after he error has been made, provided the opponent was not
hindered.
<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> An out call on A's shot to B's court must be made before B's shot has either gone out of play or has been hit by A. See <A HREF="#R29c3">Case 3 under Rule 29</A> regarding this situation in an umpired match.]<P>

Receiver or anything which he wears or carries, before it hits the

Player Loses Point</H3><P>

A player loses the point if:<P>

<B>(a)</B> He fails, before the ball in play has hit the ground twice
consecutively, to return it directly over the net (except as provided
in <A HREF="#R24a">Rule 24(a)</A> or <A HREF="#R24c">(c)</A>); or<P>

<B>(b)</B> He returns the ball in play so that it hits the ground, a
permanent fixture, or other object, outside any of the lines which
bound his opponent's Court (except as provided in <A HREF="#R24a">Rule 24(a)</A> or <A HREF="#R24c">(c)</A>);
or<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> A ball hitting a scoring device or other object
attached to a net post results in loss of point to the striker.]<P>

<A NAME="R20c"><B>(c)</B> He</A> volleys the ball and fails to make a good return even when standing outside the Court; or<P>

<A NAME="R20d"><B>(d)</B> In</A> playing the ball he deliberately carries or catches it on his racket or deliberately touches it with his racket more than once; or<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> Only when there is a definite "second push " by the
player does his shot become illegal, with consequent loss of point.  The word 'deliberately' is the key word in this rule. Two hits occurring in the course of a single continuous swing are not deemed a double hit.]<P>

<A NAME="R20e"><B>(e)</B></A> He or his racket (in his hand or otherwise) or anything which he wears or carries touches the net, posts, singles sticks, cord or metal cable, strap or band, or the ground within his opponent's Court at any time while the ball is in play; or<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> Touching a pipe support that runs across the court at
the bottom of the net is interpreted as touching the net; See <A HREF="#R23com">USTA Comment under Rule 23</A> for a ball which hits a pipe support.]<P>

<B>(f)</B> He volleys the ball before it has passed the net; or<P>

<A NAME="R20g"><B>(g)</B> The</A> ball in play touches him or anything that he wears or carries, except his racket in his hand or hands; or<P>

player is inside or outside the bounds of his court when the ball touches him.]<P>

<A NAME="R20h"><B>(h)</B> He</A> throws his racket at and hits the ball; or<P>

<B>(i)</B> He deliberately and materially changes the shape of his racket
during the playing of the point.<P>

<B>Case 1.</B> In serving, the racket flies from the Server's hand and touches
the net before the ball has touched the ground. Is his a fault or does
the player lose he point?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> The Server loses the point because his racket touches the
net while the ball is in play (<A HREF="#R20e">Rule 20 (e)</A>).<P>

<B>Case 2.</B> In serving the racket flies from the Server's hand and touches the net after the ball has touched the ground outside the proper court. Is
this a fault or does the player lose the point?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> This is a fault because the ball was out of play when he
racket touched the net.<P>

<B>Case 3.</B> A and B are playing against C and D. A is serving to D. C
touches the net before the ball touches the ground. A fault is then
called because the service falls outside the Service Court. Do C and D
lose he point?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> The call "fault" is an erroneous one. C and D had already
lost the point before "fault" could be called because C touched the
net whilst the ball was in play (<A HREF="#R20e">Rule 20 (e)</A>).<P>

<B>Case 4.</B> May a player jump over the net into his opponent's Court while
the ball is in play and not suffer penalty?<P>

<B>Case 5.</B> A cuts the ball just over the net and it returns to A's side.
B, unable to reach the ball, throws his racket and hits the ball. Both
racket and ball fall over the net on A's Court. A returns the ball
outside of B's Court. Does B win or lose the point?<P>

<B>Case 6.</B> A player standing outside the service Court is struck by a
service ball before it has touched the ground. Does he win or lose the

provided under <A HREF="#R14a">Rule 14 (a)</A>.<P>

<B>Case 7.</B> A player standing outside the Court volleys the ball or catches
it in his hand and claims the point because the ball was certainly
going out of court.<P>

Player Hinders Opponent<P></H3>

If a player commits any act which hinders his opponent in making a
stroke, then, if this is deliberate, he shall lose the point or if
involuntary, the point shall be replayed.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> 'Deliberate' means a player did what he intended to do, although the resulting effect on his opponent might or might not have been what he intended. Example: a player, after his return is in the air, gives advice to his partner in such a loud voice that his opponent is hindered. 'Involuntary' means a non-intentional act such as a hat blowing off or a scream resulting from a sudden wasp sting.]<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> Upon appeal by a competitor that the server's action in discarding a "second ball" after a rally has started constitutes a distraction (hindrance), the Umpire, if he deems the claim valid, shall require the server to make some other satisfactory disposition of the ball.  Failure to comply with this instruction shall result in loss of a point on each
occasion.]<P> 

<B>Case 1.</B> Is a player liable to a penalty if in making a stroke he
touches his opponent?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> No, unless the Umpire deems it necessary to take action under
<A HREF="#R21">Rule 21</A>.<P>

<B>Case 2.</B> When a ball bounds back over the net the player concerned may
reach over the net in order to play he ball. What is the ruling if the
player is hindered from doing this by his opponent?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> In accordance with <A HREF="#R21">Rule 21</A> the Umpire may either award the point to the player hindered or order the point to be replayed (See also <A HREF="#R25">Rule 25</A>).<P>

<B>Case 3.</B> Does an involuntary double hit constitute an act which hinders
an opponent within <A HREF="#R21">Rule 21</A>?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> No.<P>

<H3><A NAME="R22">RULE 22</A><BR>
Ball Falls on Line<P></H3>

A ball falling on a line is regarded as falling in the Court bounded by that line.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> In a non-officiated singles match, each player makes
the call on any ball hit toward his side of the net.  If a player cannot call a ball out with surety he should regard it as good.  In doubles, normally the Receiver's partner makes the calls with respect to the service line, with the Receiver calling on the side and center lines, but either partner may make the call on any ball he clearly sees out.]<P>

Ball Touches Permanent Fixtures</H3><P>

If the ball in play touches a permanent fixture other than the net, posts, singles sticks, cord or metal cable, strap or band) after it has hit the ground, the player who struck it wins the point; if before it hits the ground, his opponent wins the point.<P>

<A NAME="R23com">[<B>USTA Comment:</B></A> A ball in play that strikes a pipe support running across the court at the base of the net is treated the same as a ball landing on clear ground. See also <A HREF="#R20e">Rule

A Good Return<P></H3>

It is a good return:<P>

<A NAME="R24a"><B>(a)</B> If</A> the ball touches the net, posts, singles sticks, cord or metal
cable, strap or band, provided that it passes over any of them and
hits the ground within the court; or<P>

<B>(b)</B> If the ball, served or returned, hits the ground within the proper
Court and rebounds or is blown back over the net, and the player whose
turn it is to strike reaches over the net and plays the ball, provided
that neither he nor any part of his clothes or racket touches the net,
posts, singles sticks, cord or metal cable strap or band or the ground
within his opponent's Court, and that the stroke is otherwise good, or<P>

<A NAME="R24c"><B>(c)</B> If</A> the ball is returned outside the posts, or singles sticks, either above or below the level of the top of the net, even though it touches the posts or singles sticks, provided that it hits the ground
within the proper Court, or<P>

<A NAME="R24d"><B>(d)</B> If</A> a player's racket passes over the net after he has returned the ball provided the ball passes the net before being played and is properly returned; or<P>

<B>(e)</B> If a player succeeds in returning the ball, served or in play,
which strikes a ball lying in the Court.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> Paragraph (e) of the rule refers to a ball lying on the
court at the start of the point, as a result of a service let or fault, or as a result of a player dropping it. If a ball in play strikes a rolling or stationary "foreign" ball that has come from elsewhere after the point started, a let should be played. See Case 7 under <A HREF="#R25">Rule 25</A> and note that it pertains to an object other than a ball that is being used in the match.]<P>

<A NAME="R24N"><B>Note</A> to <A HREF="#R24">Rule 24</A>:</B> In a singles match, if, for the sake of convenience, a doubles Court is equipped with singles sticks for the purpose of a singles game then the doubles posts and those portions of the net, cord or metal cable and the band outside such singles sticks shall at all times be permanent fixtures, and are not regarded as posts or parts of the net of a singles game.<P>

A return that passes under the net cord between the singles stick and
adjacent doubles post without touching either net cord, net or doubles
post and falls within the court, is a good return.<P>

[USTA Comment: But in doubles this would be a "through" -- loss of point.]<P>

<A NAME="R24c1"><B>Case 1.</B></A> A ball going out of Court hits a net post or singles stick and falls within the lines of the opponent's Court. Is the stroke good?<P>

<B>Case 2.</B> Is it a good return if a player returns the ball holding his
racket in both hands?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> Yes.<P>

<B>Case 3.</B> The service, or ball in play, strikes a ball lying in the
Court.  Is the point won or lost thereby?<P>

[USTA Comment: A ball that is touching a boundary line is considered to be "lying in the court".]<P>

<B>Decision.</B> No. Play must continue. If it is not clear to the Umpire that
the right ball is returned a let should be called.<P>

<B>Case 4.</B> May a player use more than one racket at any time during play?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> No; the whole implication of the Rules is singular.<P>

<B>Case 5.</B> May a player request that a ball or balls lying in his
opponent's Court be removed?<P>

Hindrance of a Player</H3><P>

In case a player is hindered in making a stroke by anything not within
his control, except a permanent fixture of the Court, or except as
provided for in <A HREF="#R21">Rule 21</A>, a let shall be called.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> See <A HREF="#R13">Rule 13</A> and its USTA Comments regarding lets.]<P>

<B>Case 1.</B> A spectator gets into the way of a player, who fails to return
the ball. May the player then claim a let?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> Yes, if in the Umpire's opinion he was obstructed by
circumstances beyond his control, but not it due to permanent fixtures
of the Court or the arrangements of the ground.<P>

<B>Case 2.</B> A player is interfered with as in Case No. 1, and the Umpire
calls a let. The Server had previously served a fault. Has he the
right to two services?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> Yes: as the ball is in play, the point, not merely the
stroke, must be replayed as the Rule provides.<P>

<B>Case 3.</B> May a player claim a let under <A HREF="#R25">Rule 25</A> because he thought his
opponent was being hindered, and consequently did not expect the ball
to be returned?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> No.<P>

<B>Case 4.</B> Is a stroke good when a ball in play hits another ball in the
air?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> A let should be called unless the other ball is in the air
by the act of one of the players, in which case the Umpire will decide
under <A HREF="#R21">Rule 21</A>.<P>

<B>Case 5.</B> If an Umpire or other judge erroneously calls "fault" or "out",
and then corrects himself, which of the calls shall prevail?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> A let must be called unless in the opinion of the Umpire,
neither player is hindered in his game, in which case the corrected
call shall prevail.<P>

<B>Case 6.</B> If the first ball served, a fault, rebounds, interfering with
the Receiver at the time of the second service, may the Receiver claim
a let?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> Yes. But if he had an opportunity to remove the ball from
the Court and negligently failed to do so, he may not claim a let.<P>

<B>Case 7.</B> Is it a good stroke if the ball touches a stationary or moving
object on the Court?<P>

<B>Decision.</B>  It is a good stroke unless the stationary object came into
Court after the ball was put into play, in which case a let must be
called. If the ball in play strikes an object moving along or above
the surface of the Court, a let must be called.<P>

<B>Case 8.</B> What is the ruling if the first service is a fault, the second
service correct, and it becomes necessary to call a let either under
the provision of <A HREF="#R25">Rule 25</A> or if the Umpire is unable to decide the point?<P>

played. Are the points already played counted?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> If the error is discovered before the ball is put in play
for the second point, the first point shall be counted but the error
shall be corrected immediately. If the error is discovered after the

continued. If the score thereafter reaches eight games all or a higher
even number, a tie-break shall be played.<P>

<A NAME="R27c3"><B>Case 3.</B></A> If during a tie-break in a singles or doubles game, a player
serves out of turn, shall the order of service remain as altered until
the end of the game?<P>

the application of specific facts, shall first be determined by the
Umpire.  However, if the Umpire is uncertain or if a player appeals
from his determination, then the Referee shall be requested to give a
decision, and his decision is final.<P>

<B>Case 2.</B> A ball is called out but a player claims that the ball was
good. May the Referee give a ruling?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> No. This is a question of fact, that is an issue relating to

<B>Case 4.</B> A Linesman calls a ball out. The Umpire was unable to see
clearly, although he thought the ball was in. May he overrule the

<B>Decision.</B> No. An Umpire may only overrule if he considers that a call
was incorrect beyond all reasonable doubt. He may only overrule a ball
determined good by a Linesman if he has been able to see a space
between the ball and the line; and he may only overrule a ball
determined out, or a fault, by a Linesman if he has seen the ball hit
the line, or fall inside the line.<P>

<B>Case 5.</B> May a Linesman change his call after the Umpire has given the
score?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> Yes. If a Linesman realizes he has made an error, he may
make a correction provided he does so immediately.<P>

<B>Case 6.</B> A player claims his return shot was good after a Linesman

by the Server without delay.<P>

The Receiver must play to the reasonable pace of the Server and must
be ready to receive when the Server is ready to serve.<P>

When changing ends a maximum of one minute thirty seconds shall elapse
from the moment the ball goes out of play at the end of the game to

at any time exceed 20 seconds from the moment the ball goes out of play at the end of one point to the time the ball is struck for the next point.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> The 20 second rule applies only to certain international circuits and team events recognized by the ITF.  When practical, in USTA sanctioned tournaments using a certified official in direct observation of the match, the time which shall elapse from the moment the ball goes out of play at the end of the point to the time the ball is struck shall not exceed 25 seconds.]<P>

<B>(c)</B> If, through circumstances outside the control of the player, his
clothing, footwear or equipment (excluding racket) becomes out of
adjustment in such a way that it is impossible or undesirable for him
to play on, the Umpire may suspend play while the maladjustment is
rectified.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> If equipment other than a racket becomes unusable through circumstances outside the control of the player, play may be suspended for a reasonable period and the player may leave the court to correct the problem.  If a racket or racket string is broken, Rule 30 does not permit play to be suspended.  A player who leaves the court to get a replacement is subject to code violation(s) under the Point Penalty
System.]<P>

<A NAME="R30com2">[<B>USTA Comment:</B></A> Loss of, or damage to, a contact lens or eyeglasses shall be treated as equipment maladjustment.  All players must follow the same rules with respect to suspending play, even though in misty but playable weather, a player who wears glasses may be handicapped.]<P>

<B>(d)</B> The Umpire may suspend or delay play at any time as may be
necessary and appropriate.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> When a match is resumed after a suspension of more than ten minutes, it is permissible for the players to engage in a re-warm-up that may be of the same duration as that at the start of the match. The preferred method is to warm-up with other used balls and then insert the match balls when play starts. If the match balls are used in the re-warm-up, then the next ball change will be two games sooner. There shall be no re-warm-up after an authorized intermission or after a suspension of ten minutes or less.]<P>

<A NAME="R30e"><B>(e)</B> After</A> the third set, or when women take part the second set, either player is entitled to a rest, which shall not exceed 10
minutes, or in countries situated between latitude 15 degrees north and latitude 15 degrees south, 45 minutes and furthermore, when necessitated by circumstances not within the control of the players, the Umpire may suspend play for such a period as he may consider necessary. If play is suspended and is not resumed until a later day the rest may be taken only after the third set (or when women take part the second set) of play on such a later day, completion of an unfinished set being counted as one set.<P>

If play is suspended and is not resumed until 10 minutes have elapsed
in the same day the rest may be taken only after three consecutive
sets have been played without interruption (or when women take part
two sets), completion of an unfinished set being counted as one set.<P>

Any nation and/or committee organizing a tournament, match or
competition, other than the International Tennis Championships (Davis
Cup and Federation Cup), is at liberty to modify this provision or
omit it from its regulations provided this is announced before the
event commences.<P>

<B>(f)</B> A tournament committee has the discretion to decide the time
allowed for a warm-up period prior to a match but this may not exceed
five minutes and must be announced before the event commences.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> When there are no ballpersons this time may be extended to ten minutes.]<P>

<B>(g)</B> When approved point penalty and non-accumulative point penalty
systems are in operation, the Umpire shall make his decisions within
the terms of those systems.<P>

<B>(h)</B> Upon violation of the principle that play shall be continuous the
Umpire may, after giving due warning, disqualify the offender.<P>

<H3><A NAME="R31">RULE 31</A><BR>
Coaching</H3><P>

During the playing of a match in a team competition, a player may
receive coaching from a captain who is sitting on the court only when
he changes ends at the end of a game, but not when he changes ends
during a tie-break game.<P>

A player may not receive coaching during the playing of any other
match.<P>

After due warning an offending player may be disqualified. When an
approved point penalty system is in operation, the Umpire shall impose
penalties according to that system.<P>

<B>Case 1.</B> Should a warning be given, or the player be disqualified, if
the coaching is given by signals in an unobtrusive manner?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> The Umpire must take action as soon as he becomes aware that coaching is being given verbally or by signals. If the Umpire is
unaware that coaching is being given, a player may draw his attention
to the fact that advice is being given.<P>

<B>Case 2.</B> Can a player receive coaching during an authorized rest period
under <A HREF="#R30e">Rule 30(e)</A>, or when play is interrupted and he leaves the court?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> Yes. In these circumstances, when the player is not on the
court, there is no restriction on coaching.<P>

<B>ITF Note:</B> The word "coaching" includes any advice or instruction.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> Coaching is not permitted in the USTA Adult and Senior League Program except during authorized rest periods.]<P>

<H3><A NAME="R32">RULE 32</A><BR>
Changing Balls</H3><P>

In cases where balls are to be changed after a specified number of
games, if the balls are not changed in the correct sequence, the
mistake shall be corrected when the player, or pair in the case of
doubles, who should have served with new balls is next due to serve.
Thereafter the balls shall be changed so that the number of games
between changes shall be that originally agreed.<P>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="DG">The Doubles Game</A></H2><P>

<H3><A NAME="R33">RULE 33</A></H3><P>

The above Rules shall apply to the Doubles Game except as below.<P>

<H3><A NAME="R34">RULE 34</A><BR>
The Doubles Court</H3><P>

For the Doubles Game, the Court shall be 36 feet (10.97m.) in width,
i.e. 4.5 feet (1.37m.) wider on each side than the Court for the Singles
Game, and those portions of the singles side-lines which lie between
the two service-lines shall be called the service side-lines. In other
respects, the Court shall be similar to that described in <A HREF="#R1">Rule 1</A>, but the portions of the singles side-lines between the base-line and
service-line on each side of the net may be omitted if desired.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> The Server has the right in doubles to stand anywhere
back of the baseline between the center mark imaginary extension and the doubles sideline imaginary extension.]<P>

<H3><A NAME="R35">RULE 35</A><BR>
Order of Service in Doubles<P>
</H3>
The order of serving shall be decided at the beginning of each set as
follows:<P>

The pair who have to serve in the first game of each set shall decide
which partner shall do so and the opposing pair shall decide similarly
for the second game. The partner of the player who served in the first
game shall serve in the third; the partner of the player who served in
the second game shall serve in the fourth, and so on in the same order
in all the subsequent games of a set.<P>

<B>Case 1.</B> In doubles one player does not appear in time to play, and his
partner claims to be allowed to play single-handed against the opposing
players. May he do so?<P>  

<B>Decision.</B> No.<P>

<H3><A NAME="R36">RULE 36</A><BR>
Order of Receiving in Doubles</H3><P>

The order of receiving the service shall be decided at the beginning
of each set as follows:<P>

The pair who have to receive the service in the first game shall
decide which partner shall receive the first service, and that partner
shall continue to receive the first service in every odd game
throughout that set. The opposing pair shall likewise decide which
partner shall receive the first service in the second game and that
partner shall continue to receive the first service in every even game
throughout that set. Partners shall receive the service alternately
throughout each game.<P>

<B>Case 1.</B> Is it allowable in doubles for the server's partner or the
Receiver's partner to stand in a position that obstructs the view of
the Receiver?<P>

<B>Decision.</B> Yes. The Server's partner or the Receiver's partner may take
any position on his side of the net in or out of the Court that he
wishes.<P>

<H3><A NAME="R37">RULE 37</A><BR>
Service Out of Turn in Doubles</H3><P>

If a partner serves out of his turn, the partner who ought to have
served shall serve as soon as the mistake is discovered, but all
points scored, and any faults served before such discovery, shall be
reckoned. If a game shall have been completed before such discovery,
the order of service remains as altered.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> For an exception to <A HREF="#R37">Rule 37</A> see <A HREF="#R27c3">Case 3 under Rule 27</A>.]<P>

<H3><A NAME="R38">RULE 38</A><BR>
Error in Order of Receiving in Doubles</H3><P>

If during a game the order of receiving the service is changed by the
Receivers it shall remain as altered until the end of the game in
which the mistake is discovered, but the partners shall resume their
original order of receiving in the next game of that set in which they
are Receivers of the service.<P>

<H3><A NAME="R39">RULE 39</A><BR>
Service Fault in Doubles</H3><P>

The service is a fault as provided for by <A HREF="#R10">Rule 10</A>, or if the ball touches the Server's partner or anything which he wears or carries,
but if the ball served touches the partner of the Receiver, or anything which he wears or carries, not being a let under <A HREF="#R14a">Rule 14(a)</A>
before it hits the ground, the Server wins the point.<P>

<H3><A NAME="R40">RULE 40</A><BR>
Playing the Ball in Doubles</H3><P>

The ball shall be struck alternately by one or other player of the opposing pairs, and if a player touches the ball in play with his racket in contravention of this Rule, his opponents win the point.<P>

[<B>USTA Comment:</B> The partners themselves do not have to "alternate" in making returns. In the course of making one return, only one member of a doubles team may hit the ball.  If both of them hit the ball, either simultaneously or consecutively, it is an illegal return.  Mere clashing of rackets does not make a return illegal unless it is clear that more than one racket touched the ball.]<P>

<H2><A NAME="A1">APPENDIX I</H2>
<H3>Regulations for Making Tests Specified in <A HREF="#R3">Rule 3</A></H3>
</CENTER>

<B>1.</B> Unless otherwise specified all tests shall be made at a temperature of approximately 68&#176; Fahrenheit (20&#176; Centigrade) and a relative humidity of approximately 60 per cent.  All balls should be removed from their container and kept at the recognized temperature and humidity for 24 hours prior to testing, and shall be at that temperature and humidity when the test is commenced.<P>

<B>2.</B> Unless otherwise specified the limits are for a test conducted in an atmospheric pressure resulting in a barometric reading of approximately 30 inches (76cm.).<P>

<B>3.</B> Other standards may be fixed for localities where the average temperature, humidity or average barometric pressure at which the game is being played differs materially from 68&#176; Fahrenheit (20&#176; Centigrade), 60 per cent and 30 inches (76cm.) respectively.<P>

Applications for such adjusted standards may be made by any National Association to the International Tennis Federation and if approved shall be adopted for such localities.<P>

<B>4.</B> In all tests for diameter a ring gauge shall be used consisting of a metal plate, preferably non-corrosive, of a uniform thickness of one-eighth of an inch (.32cm.) in which there are two circular openings 2.575 inches (6.54cm.) and 2.700 inches (6.86cm.) in diameter respectively.  The inner surface of the gauge shall have a convex profile with a radius of one-sixteenth of an inch (.16cm.).  The ball shall not drop through the smaller opening by its own weight and shall drop through the larger opening by its own weight.<P>

<B>5.</B> In all tests for deformation conducted under <A HREF="#R3">Rule 3</A>, the machine designed by Percy Herbert Stevens and patented in Great Britain under Patent No. 230250, together with the subsequent additions and improvements thereto, including the modifications required to take return deformations, shall be employed or such other machine which is approved by a National Association and gives equivalent readings to the Stevens machine.<P>

<B>6.</B> Procedure for carrying out tests.<P>

<B>(a)</B> Pre-compression.  Before any ball is tested it shall be steadily compressed by approximately one inch (2.54cm.) on each of three diameters at right angles to one another in succession; this process to be carried out three times (nine compressions in all).  All tests to be completed within two hours of precompression.<P>

<B>(b)</B> Bound test (as in <A HREF="#R3">Rule 3</A>).  Measurements are to be taken from the concrete base to the bottom of the ball.<P>

<B>(c)</B> Size test (as in paragraph 4 above).<P>

<B>(d)</B> Weight test (as in <A HREF="#R3">Rule 3</A>).<P>

<B>(e)</B> Deformation test.  The ball is placed in position on the modified Stevens machine so that neither platen of the machine is in contact with the cover seam.  The contact weight is applied, the pointer and the mark brought level, and the dials set to zero.  The test weight equivalent to 18 lb. (8.165kg.) is placed on the beam and pressure applied by turning the wheel at a uniform speed so that five seconds elapse from the instant the beam leaves its seat until the pointer is brought level with the mark.  When turning ceases the reading is recorded (forward deformation).  The wheel is turned again until figure ten is reached on the scale (one inch [2.54cm.] deformation).  The wheel is then rotated in the opposite direction at a uniform speed (thus releasing pressure) until the beam pointer again coincides with the mark.  After waiting ten seconds the pointer is adjusted to the mark if necessary.  The reading is then recorded (return deformation).  This procedure is repeated on each ball across the two diameters at right angles to the initial position and to each other.<P>

<H2><A NAME="A2">APPENDIX II</A></H2>
<H3>Rules of Wheelchair Tennis</H3>
</CENTER>

The game of wheelchair tennis follows the same rules as able-bodied tennis as endorsed by the International Tennis Foundation except the wheelchair tennis player is allowed two bounces of the ball.
<P>

<A NAME="AR1"></A>
<B>1.</B> <I>The Competitive Wheelchair Tennis Player.</I>  The only eligibility requirements for an individual to become a competitive wheelchair tennis player is that he must be medically diagnosed as having a mobility-related disability.  In other words, he must have substantial or total loss of function in one or more extremities.  If, as a result of these functional limitations, this person would be unable to play competitive able-bodied tennis (that is, having the mobility to cover the court with adequate speed), then the person would be eligible to play competitive wheelchair tennis in sanctioned IWTF tournaments.
<P>

<B>(a)</B> Quadriplegic division players shall be characterized as one who has limited mobility, power and strength in at least three limbs due to accidents, spinal cord injuries and other related diseases.  Also included in this division are walking quadriplegics, power wheelchair-users and triple amputees.  Players who cannot use both arms to move the chair are allowed to use their legs.  In case of doubt it is up to the IWTF to make a decision if the player is allowed to use his legs.
<P>

If there is reason to doubt an individual's eligibility to participate as a competitive wheelchair tennis players, the IWTF rules committee reserves the right to screen any player being considered for ranking.  A verification of quadriplegic status may be required, when in doubt.
<P>

<A NAME="AR2"></A>
<B>2.</B> The Ball In Play<P>

In wheelchair tennis the ball is allowed to bounce twice before being returned.<P>

<B>(a)</B> If the ball is taken on the first bounce, it must bounce within the bounds of the court.<P>

<B>(b)</B> If the ball is taken on the second bounce, the second bounce can hit the ground either within the boundaries of the court or outside the court boundaries before being returned.<P>

<A NAME="AR3"></A>
<B>3.</B> The Service<P>

<B>(a)</B> The ball served may, after hitting the ground in the service court, hit the ground once again within the bounds of the court or outside the court boundaries before being returned.<P>

<B>(b)</B> The server shall throughout the delivery of the service:<BR>
-- Not change position by rolling or spinning.  The server shall not by slight movements of the wheels which do not materially affect the location originally taken up by him, be deemed "to change his position by rolling or spinning."<BR>
-- Not touch, with <B>any</B> wheel, any area other than that behind the baseline within the imaginary extension of the center-mark and sideline.<P>

<B>(c)</B> If the player deliberately uses any part of his lower extremities as brakes or as stabilizers while delivering service, the service is deemed a fault.<P>

<B>(d)</B> If conventional methods for the service are physically impossible for a quadriplegic player, then another individual may drop the ball for such a player.<P>

<B>4.</B> Player Loses Point.  The wheelchair is part of the body.  All applicable rules apply.  A player loses the point if:<P>

<B>(a)</B> The ball in play touches him or his wheelchair or anything he wears or carries, except his racket in his hand(s).  This loss of a point occurs regardless of whether the player is inside or outside the bounds of his court when the ball touches him.<P>

<B>(b)</B> A served ball hits him or his wheelchair or anything he wears or carries, except his racket in his hand(s).  If the server hits his own partner with the served ball, then it is a fault.<P>

<B>(c)</B> He deliberately uses any part of his feet or lower extremities as brakes or as stabilizers while delivering the service, stroking a ball, turning or stopping.<P>

<B>(d)</B> He fails to keep one buttock in contact with his wheelchair seat contacting the ball.<BR>
It is legal for a player to hit a return, fall out of his chair and then get back into his chair to make the next return.<P>

<B>5.</B> Wheelchair/Able-Bodied Tennis.  Where a wheelchair player is defined in <a href="#AR1">Rule 1</a> above is playing with able-bodied persons, then again the rules of tennis shall apply.<P>

In this instance, however, the wheelchair player is allowed only one bounce and Rules <a href="#AR2">2</a> and <a href="#AR3">3</a> above shall therefore not apply.<P>

<CENTER>
<H2><A NAME="A3">APPENDIX III</A></H2>
<H3>Tie-Breaks and No-Ad Scoring</H3>
</CENTER>

<B>1.</B> Tie-Break Use Mandatory.  Use of the 12-point tie-break is mandatory in all sanctioned tournaments in all sets.<P>

<B>2.</B> Twelve-Point Tie-Break<P>

Singles.  Player A, having served the first game of the set, serves the first point from the right court; Player B serves points 2 and 3 (left and right); A serves points 4 and 5 (left and right); B serves point 6 (left) and after they change ends, point 7 (right); A serves points 8 and 9 (left and right); B serves points 10 and 11 (left and right); A serves point 12 (left).  A player who reaches seven points during these first 12 points wins the game and set.  If the score has reached six points all, the players change ends and continue in the same pattern until one player establishes a margin of two points which gives him the game and set.  Note that the players change ends every six points and that the player who serves the last point of one of these 6-point segments also serves the first point of the next one (from right court).  For a following set the players change ends and B serves the first game.<P>

Doubles.  The same pattern as in singles applies, with partners preserving their serving sequence.  In a game of A-B versus C-D, with A having served the first game of the set, A serves the first point (right); C serves points 2 and 3 (left and right); B serves points 4 and 5 (left and right); D serves point 6 (left) and after the teams change ends, D serves point 7 (right); A serves points 8 and 9 (left and right); C serves points 10 and 11 (left and right); B serves point 12 (left).  A team that wins seven points during these first 12 points wins the game and set.  If the score has reached six points all, the teams change ends.  B then serves point 13 (right), and they continue until one team establishes a two-point margin and thus wins the game and set.  As in singles, they change ends for one game to start a following set, with team C-D to serve first.<P>

<B>3.</B> Experimental 12-point tie-break.  The experimental 12-point tie-break is the same as the present 12-point tie-break except that ends are changed after the first point, then after every four points, and at the conclusion of the tie-break game.<P>

<B>4.</B> When experimental 12-point tie-break is authorized.  For experimental purposes, a section may authorize any tournament below the National Championship level to use the experimental 12-point tie-break.  For experimental purposes, the USTA Sanctions and Schedules Committee may authorize the use of the experimental 12-point tie-break for any other tournament.  Any tournament electing to use the experimental 12-point tie-break must announce the election before the start of tournament play.<P>

<B>5.</B> Recording the tie-break score.  The score of the tie-break set will be written 7-6(x) or 6-7(x), with (x) being the number of points won by the loser of the tie break.  For example, 7-6(4) means the tie-break score was 7-4, and 6-7(14) means the tie-break score was 14-16.<P>

<B>6.</B> Changing ends during the tie-break.  Changes of ends during a tie-break game are to be made within the normal time allowed between points.<P>

<B>7.</B> Ball changes.  If a ball change is due on a tie-break game, it will be deferred until the start of the second game of the next set.  A tie-break game counts as one game in determining ball changes.<P>

<B>8.</B> No-Ad scoring.  The No-Ad procedure is simply what the name implies; the first player to win four points wins the game, with the seventh point of a game becoming a game point for each player.  The receiver has the choice of advantage court or deuce court to which the service is to be delivered on the seventh point.  No-ad scoring is authorized for tournaments at the sectional championship level and below.  A tournament electing to use no-ad scoring must announce the election before the start of the tournament play except as set forth in <a href="#A39">paragraph 9</a> below.<P>

Note:  The score-calling may be either in the conventional terms or in simple number, i.e., "zero, one, two, three, game."<P>

Cautionary Note:  Any ITF-authorized tournament should get special authorization from ITF before using No-Ad.<P>

<A NAME="A39"></A>
<B>9.</B> Change to No-Ad scoring.  The referee can switch to no-ad scoring from regular scoring in any round without prior notice on the entry blank when in the referee's discretion the change is necessary to complete the tournament after inclement weather or other factors cause the tournament to fall behind its published schedule.
