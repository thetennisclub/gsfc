YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO UNDERSTAND TENNIS
</b>
</p>

<p>
No, wait, maybe you do.

<p>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (better known as NASA) recently announced that it is funding a $149,000 study to look into the science of tennis.  Just what really happens, physics-wise, to racquet and ball when Goran Ivanisevic blasts a 135-m.p.h. serve or Martina Hingis whips a topspin crosscourt passing shot?  Now we'll know.  The study will be conducted by Cislunar Aerospace Inc. of Napa, Calif., in collaboration with the John Yandell Tennis School of San Francisco.

<p>
Employing the latest NASA technology, including state-of-the-art digital video cameras, the study will examine ball behavior, the differences among court surfaces, the properties of racquets and the biomechanics of professional-level play.
</p>

<p>
Why is NASA interested?  It wants to remind people that its high-flying programs can have down-to-earth value cspecially for education.  The agency plans to engage school kids nationwide in the enterprise via the Internet, encouraging them as the study progresses to pose questions and analyze data in video conferences with players and scientists.
</p>

<p>
Along the way, U.S. Tennis Association experts will help interpret the study's results.  Possible long-range benefits for us average players: new high-tech racquets and 21st-century computer games that will let you perfect your return of serve against a virtual Goran.
