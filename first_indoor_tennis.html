LONGBOAT KEY, Fla. (AP) -- Jerry Schneider, the man credited with building the first indoor tennis facility, has died. He was 87.
<p>
Schneider died of complications from lung cancer on July 18 2007, his daughter Marlon Barden told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from her Highland Park, Ill. home Friday.
<p>
Schneider established the North Shore Racquet Club in 1961 in the Chicago suburb of Glenview, using money his father loaned him. He wanted to be able to play tennis through harsh Chicago winters. It wasn't a sure success. Banks didn't want to offer credit, and fellow players weren't sure about the concept.
<p>
"Everybody sort of laughed at him and said no one will ever play tennis inside," Barden said.
<p>
That changed when Schneider opened four indoor tennis courts. Business took off, and he soon expanded to eight courts.
<p>
"Once it was built, everyone wanted to play indoor tennis," Schneider's ex-wife Joy said.
<p>
He sold the club in the early 1970s, but it is still in business.
<p>
Schneider grew up on Chicago's West Side and ran track at Northwestern University before serving in World War II. He was always athletic but became particularly interested in tennis after the war. Schneider, who moved to Florida in 1975, worked for his father before starting the club.
<p>
Recently, he won national doubles titles in the 80-and-over and 85-and-over men's divisions in the Senior Olympics.
<p>
In addition to his daughter and ex-wife, Schneider is survived by a son, Blake, and granddaughter, Taylor, as well as his longtime companion, Darlene Collins.
<p>
"A year ago today he was playing tennis," his daughter said.
<p>
A private funeral was held, but a service celebrating Schneider's life has been scheduled for Sept. 30 in Highland Park, Ill., and Jan. 6, at the Club Longboat clubhouse in Longboat Key, Fla.
