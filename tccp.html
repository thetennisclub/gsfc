Late-coming NASA folks are still eligable for the discount rate.  </b></font><hr><p>The <a href="http://www.thetccp.com/">Tennis Center at College Park</a> (TCCP, as they like to be called, <a href="http://www.thetccp.com/">http://www.thetccp.com/</a>) is located at 5200 Paint Branch Parkway, just east of the College Park Metro stop in suburban Maryland, about 2 miles inside the Beltway from the Kennilworth Avenue interchange.<p>TCCP has 12 indoor courts (8 Deco-Turf and 4 Har-Tru) in addition to 18 outdoor courts (deco-turf, har-tru, and French red clay).  The outdoor Har-Tru is similar to the GTC courts, without the bad bounces.  The indoor Har-Tru is fast, hard, dry clay with a dusting of sand.  They also have a fitness facility, sauna, massage service, pro shop, pros, a ladder, team tennis, a major juniors program, events every month, etc..  TCCP also hosts the University of Maryland's varsity tennis teams. <p>Indoor time is $20/hr prime time, $15/hr off-prime. Outdoor play is free.  You can buy indoor spot time or a 7-month contract (1.0, 1.5 or 2.0 hours) during the winter.  <p>Standard TCCP membership is $75/month ($105 family) in one-year contracts, plus a $75 initiation fee (more for people outside Prince Georges and Montgomery county). <p>TCCP has a number of weekly round-robins where you just buy into the time-block and show up to play.  For example, one can buy into a 12 week block of time for $180 ($10/hr, balls supplied by TCCP), and play 3 different doubles matches in 1.5 hour.    The skill-level of these groups is comparable to the 5-10 range of the <a href="http://rsd.gsfc.nasa.gov/tennisclub/tennisladder.html">GTC ladder.</a> <p>Call TCCP for a tour (301-779-8000).  You can get some play (3 sessions) as a guest.  <p><hr>This page is maintained by: <address><a href="mailto:Dennis.Chesters@nasa.gov">Dennis.Chesters@nasa.gov</a></address><p><a href="http://tennisclub.gsfc.nasa.gov/">The Goddard Tennis Club home page</a></body></html>
